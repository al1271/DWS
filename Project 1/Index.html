	<p> Apple was founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne on April 1, 1976, to develop and sell personal computers. It was incorporated as Apple Computer, Inc. on January 3, 1977, and was renamed as Apple Inc. on January 9, 2007, to reflect its shifted focus towards consumer electronics.</p>
	
	<p> Apple was established on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne[20][21] to sell the Apple I personal computer kit. The Apple I kits were a computer single handedly designed and hand-built by Wozniak[22][23] and first shown to the public at the Homebrew Computer Club.[24] The Apple I was sold as a motherboard (with CPU, RAM, and basic textual-video chips), which is less than what is today considered a complete personal computer.[25] The Apple I went on sale in July 1976 and was market-priced at $666.66 ($2,763 in 2014 dollars, adjusted for inflation).</p>
